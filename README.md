Clustering Exercises:
Clustering is an Unsupervised machine learning methodology. Used to group and identify similar observations when we do not have labels that identify the groups. Often a preprocessing or an exploratory step in the data science pipeline. 

Clustering methodologies include:

* Partitioned based clustering (K-Means)

* Hierarchical clustering

* Density-based clustering (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN))
